# o8 roadmap

o8 is for one operator running several coding agents at once. It turns work into missions and packets, runs each packet in its own worktree, keeps the operator in the approval path, and records enough evidence to explain later what happened. All seven pillars serve one outcome: an operator delegates useful work, understands its state while away, steps in when needed, and approves the result without replaying the whole session. This page says where that is going and what is open to work on.

Taste is a gate on every row here, not a pillar of its own. A change that reads badly, responds slowly, or behaves unpredictably is not finished, whichever pillar it belongs to.

## At a glance

1. **Governance is the product.** Workers cannot merge their own work. The goal is to record every decision and make every failure visible and actionable.
2. **Organizational memory.** Rules and past outcomes stay with the project, not with one model vendor.
3. **Runs on your subscriptions.** The coding-agent CLIs you already pay for, behind one runtime contract.
4. **One control plane, every surface.** Desktop, phone, CLI, MCP, headless, voice. Same verbs, different authority.
5. **Smooth for people and for agents.** Fast and legible for a person; drivable through a real interface for a program.
6. **Runs where you are.** Light on the machine, on the machine you have. Mac today; Linux and Windows have compile evidence, while maintainer VM validation is paused. Windows help is welcome.
7. **Ahead.** Longer-term bets, advanced when their next proof warrants it.

## Current focus

The [focus plan through October 27](./docs/operations/focus-through-2026-10-27.md) is the execution order for this month: installed first-run acceptance, trustworthy funnel measurement, paid-tier behavior, and Symon reliability. It includes two bounded contributor queues and weekly checkpoints. The pillar tables below retain longer-term work; an open arc is not automatically permission to start it this month.

## Now

First-run acceptance is the immediate engineering priority. Published stable is 0.1.781. A fresh stall-free first-run repeat and physical Apple Silicon execution remain unverified. A candidate run is not a public download-to-merge benchmark. Preserve the Solo tools, sent-image, and comparison stop/requeue checks. [#2211](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2211)

Shared screen layout rules, explicit agent readiness, independent project discovery, optional voice and iPhone setup, and sensory feedback are implemented in [#3345](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/pull/3345). Full-window setup follows native glass while preserving opaque browser and solid surfaces. Built-in agent runtime roles are registered; installed-app acceptance remains open in [#3246](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/3246). Managed development environment cleanup is tracked in [#3337](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/3337). These are source and development checks; installed first-run acceptance remains open.

Direct tool sign-in recovery, explicit workspace continuation, restart intent, and focus and sound follow-through are implemented in [#3374](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/pull/3374). A ready discovery result enables continuation; opening a sign-in surface never starts authentication automatically. Source completion does not establish installed acceptance or a release; voice and mobile acceptance remain with their existing work.

Update-service source work has closed. Closure does not establish deployed endpoint behavior, delivery in the installed updater, or trustworthy active-install counts. New-install usage analytics, existing opt-out preservation and matching privacy documentation remain a separate delivery gate. [#2882](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2882)

After first-run acceptance, verify paid-tier behavior through the installed app, then complete the existing Symon reliability review. Its scope includes sessions, models, tool results, interruptions, reconnect and approvals. Current Symon follow-ups retain their own prerequisite and acceptance evidence. [#2534](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2534)

Outside contributors should choose one open, unclaimed task from the [two contributor queues](./docs/operations/focus-through-2026-10-27.md#two-contributor-queues). Existing contributor PRs keep their owners; passing source checks and a merged PR are separate from release and installed acceptance.

Broad remote-project expansion is outside this month's default queue. Existing separately scoped remote and plugin work keeps its own owner, bounded acceptance and release decision; it is not automatically part of the first-run candidate. Remote recovery and continuation proof remains incomplete. [#2282](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2282)

Shared-checkout teams shipped in 0.1.771 with four-worker native evidence. Ten-worker, collision and isolated-mode acceptance remain open. Linux and Windows product validation stay parked; running existing tests on Linux does not change that status. [#2772](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2772), [#1672](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1672), [#2204](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2204)

## What we need to prove

Three outcomes decide whether the pillars add up. The first-diff comparisons below provide evidence on code quality; operator effort and the full loop's value still need measurement. A green checklist is progress on a row, not proof of the outcome.

- **A new operator finishes the loop.** Download to first merged packet, with the minutes and the stalls measured. Baseline from source: 6.8 minutes, nine stalls. The download path has no baseline yet; the update-check and usage-analytics changes above provide it. [#2211](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2211)
- **Interrupted work stays visible and recoverable.** A refusal surfaces, retries are bounded, and a replaced mission leaves no live packets behind. [#2197](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2197)
- **The governed loop earns its cost.** The product question is whether the existing workflow helps an operator finish correct, acceptable work with less measured active operator effort. Initial-patch quality remains a separate diagnostic under its original rule. Compare final accepted quality, total attempts, reviews and rework, elapsed time, and attributable usage or subscription capacity. An accurate ledger supports that comparison; it does not establish that delegation saves time or money, and subscription capacity is recorded as capacity, never converted into an invented per-token dollar saving. [#2289](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2289), [#1684](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1684), [#1791](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1791)

## How to read this

Only open arcs appear in the pillar tables. Shipped arcs are listed once at the bottom with the release they landed in. Each open arc links to one tracking issue whose checklist is the real progress; a box is checked when the child issue is closed and its fix is in a shipped release, and GitHub shows the count on the issue itself.

State words mean: **open** has children in flight; **parked** means we know what it would take and are not doing it now; **not usable** means the platform does not run o8 today, whatever the checklist says. Read the Gap column first. It says what is missing in words.

A `pillar/*` label locates a subsystem. An `area:*` label identifies an optional cross-cutting concern. Assignees and named claims record who has taken the work; categories do not assign ownership.

`node scripts/roadmap-status.mjs` prints the checklist counts. `node scripts/roadmap-status.mjs --check` fails when a checked child is still open or when a Now link points at a closed issue. A closed child whose box is unchecked is reported as awaiting release, not as drift. CI runs this check on pushes, the Sunday scheduled run, and manual dispatches, not on pull requests. The check reads issue state only: it does not read release tags and it cannot judge a Gap sentence, so the words on this page are the maintainers' to keep true.

## 1. Governance is the product

Execution is separated from approval. Workers cannot merge their own packets. This pillar requires decisions and failures to be recorded and visible, with a supported path to resolve them; the lifecycle row below tracks the remaining gaps.

| Arc | Done means | State | Gap | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lane lifecycle and recovery honesty | No lane stalls silently. Every terminal state is reachable from the UI and the CLI. | open | Every child is shipped as of 0.1.756. No interrupted lane has been shown end to end settling to a terminal state that is reachable from both the UI and the CLI, so the outcome is unproven. | [#2197](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2197) |
| Task-contract review evidence truth | File deliverables and process constraints receive distinct review evidence, and a missing default contract has an explicit recovery decision before merge. | open | Both repairs are merged in source but not released. A released-build proof and the exact packet rerun remain. | [#2682](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2682) |
| Worker capability boundaries | A worker cannot read or reach anything its packet does not grant. | open | Native workers run under the operator's user account and can read the operator's environment. | [#2198](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2198) |
| Contributor-ready public repo | An outside pull request gets green checks and a human reply without maintainer plumbing. | open | Every child is shipped as of 0.1.750. No outside pull request has gone through the claiming protocol end to end, so the outcome is unproven. | [#2199](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2199) |
| First-diff quality | A governed packet's first diff scores at least as well as the raw model coding alone on the same issue. | parked | Earlier headline comparisons reported 0/3 governed wins, but those scores were later withdrawn because judge bias could not be ruled out. Over-engineering and missed requirements remain the target failure modes. The later [paired contract trial](./docs/user/honest-benchmark-2026-08.md#track-1--coding-does-a-pre-edit-contract-improve-first-diff-quality) was mixed. The [September 12 fixed trial](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1684#issuecomment-5645498074) scored two complete tasks, with zero decisive contract wins in either runtime; one task was excluded for an invalid contract. The original decision rule remains unmet. Future intervention research is separate. | [#1684](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1684) |
| Governed task completion and operator effort | A bounded comparison produces an auditable decision about final correctness, operator effort, and overhead. | open | Protocol [#2290](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/pull/2290) is merged. The near-term step is [#2296](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2296), three real-work dogfood observations one at a time; the formal [#2288](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2288) paired pilot remains parked. | [#2289](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2289) |
| Typed judgment referee | Every advisory referee surface (approval card, Brain routing, merge-gate warning, phone inbox order and chips) runs behind one setting, writes a receipt per call, and reads a threshold only where the local calibration replay earned it. | open | Advisory surfaces shipped in 0.1.759 and replay labels shipped in 0.1.760. The risk score has no gate-failure signal in the local replay, so nothing gates on it. Replay and measurement come before another surface or a promotion decision; managed judgment has a separate hosted-service gate. | [#2481](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2481) |

## 2. Organizational memory

Project rules and prior outcomes stay attached to the project, not to one model vendor. An orchestrator and its workers share the same operating context across runtimes.

| Arc | Done means | State | Gap | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cost and capacity ledger | The ledger's number and the provider's invoice agree. | open | Nothing measures what role routing and context controls save. | [#1791](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1791) |
| Memory the operator shapes | What the operator rejects, steers, or edits becomes memory the Brain and the next worker retrieve, and any single retained item can be withdrawn from future retrieval without erasing the record that it was once applied. | open | Rejection and steer reasons are stored for audit and read by no retriever; the schema's rework flag is never written; the only way to forget one rule is to reset the whole database. | [#2221](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2221) |

## 3. Runs on your subscriptions

Local worker adapters launch the coding-agent CLIs you already pay for and reuse the authentication those tools already hold. The runtime contract keeps callers independent of any one provider's protocol.

| Arc | Done means | State | Gap | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Carrier coverage and auth probes | A new carrier lands as a registry entry plus a readiness and auth probe, with no fork in the dispatch path. | open | Readiness and auth checks are written per CLI, and the operator cannot see what evidence o8 used to call a runtime connected. The one adapter waiting is blocked on an upstream build for Intel Macs. | [#2200](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2200) |
| Local models first-class | Every surface names its local provider, and a test proves no egress for a full packet lifecycle. | parked | No surface-by-surface local path exists, and nothing proves that a packet leaves nothing behind on the network. The first narrow step is an egress baseline that names every contacted host and surface, even when it fails. | [#1451](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1451) |

## 4. One control plane, every surface

Desktop, mobile, CLI, MCP, headless, and voice reach the same governed control plane. Each caller gets its own authority; none of them gets the operator's by default.

Mobile voice intent resolution is implemented in [#3146](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/pull/3146). Entry-point tests cover paired-device access, confirmed choices scoped to a submitted chat and repository, and offline replay. Paired-phone and provider acceptance remain open.

| Arc | Done means | State | Gap | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Terminals as a workspace surface | A tmux or vim session survives an update and a pane switch byte for byte, and agent terminal actions go through a governed adapter. | open | CLI discovery is tracked in #2727, verified Codex turn events in #2729, repo-less reload in #2732, and cross-profile tmux ownership in #2733. Other CLI states, governed actions, and native multi-terminal add/close proof remain open. | [#1723](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1723) |
| Settings take effect everywhere | An operator changes a setting once and every surface uses the new value on its next action, with no reload and no second place to set it. | open | Operator defaults are snapshotted at page load and cached per terminal server; the same bug has recurred under four names. | [#2217](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2217) |
| Remote project operation | An operator reconnects to the same remote task, preview, diff, evidence, and approval path; a later packet can use another supported agent system with the same project rules. | open | Durable worker and preview work has advanced in source. The full operator-visible recovery and continuation proof remains open; broader expansion is outside the current focus window. | [#2282](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2282) |
| ChatGPT conversation orchestration | An operator plans and follows bounded CLI work with explicit account, permission and usage boundaries, while approvals remain in o8. | open | Installed private reads, one explicit continuation, retry deduplication and the current worker report passed. Source work adds a plan connection, durable held task drafts, a per-session single-attempt runtime limit, an account transition/admission guard, a controlled worker credential/tool restriction, permanent operator task/attempt admission through actual spawn and exact-contract desktop review controls. Mounted plan-settings tests now hide prior-account details in the first identity-changing commit and refuse stale replies; hosted task dispatch remains disabled. Publication, installed sign-in acceptance, installed account/lifecycle proof, installed worker admission acceptance, plan-use qualification, controlled dispatch and the allowance comparison remain open. | [#2955](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2955) |
| Symon correctness and reliability | Existing desktop and phone flows have a recorded correctness and reliability review. Confirmed failures become bounded issues; resulting fixes are verified through their real entry points and shipped. | open | The review is queued after the repair batch. | [#2534](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2534) |

## 5. Smooth for people and for agents

Two lanes, one pillar. The people lane covers the surfaces a person works in. The agents lane covers whether another program can drive o8 through a real interface instead of imitating a mouse.

| Arc | Lane | Done means | State | Gap | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First ten minutes | people | A stranger goes from download to a first merged packet, and the minutes and the stalls are measured. | open | Measured once, from source: 6.8 minutes and nine stalls. The eight frictions from that run shipped in 0.1.750. The download path is unmeasured, and no second run confirms the fixes. | [#2211](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2211) |
| Design Mode loop | people | "Change this button" is one bounded loop with a before-and-after proof card. | open | Screenshot crop timing is not measured through the supported capture path. | [#1695](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1695) |
| Bounded peer conversations | people, agents | The operator sees named participants in split transcripts and a repo-scoped Handoffs pane. Every reply has a verifiable conversation and prior message, and the server stops the exchange at its turn budget or an earlier close. | open | The UI and protocol are merged in source; an isolated preview exercised grouped turns and operator stop/extend. A native installed two-agent exchange and release check remain. | [#2690](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2690) |
| Agent-facing API manifest | agents | One manifest lists every operator verb and its surfaces, and CI fails when a verb exists on one surface and not another. | open | No manifest exists; parity between the CLI, MCP, and the webview socket is checked by hand. | [#2212](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2212) |

## 6. Runs where you are

o8 should be light on the machine it runs on, and it should run on the machine you have.

| Arc | Done means | State | Gap | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | A fresh Ubuntu machine installs o8, launches it, dispatches a packet, and merges it through the governed path. | parked | Maintainer VM validation is paused; install-to-merge proof remains outstanding. | [#1672](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1672) |
| Windows | The same as Linux, on Windows. | parked | Maintainer VM validation is paused; install-to-merge proof remains outstanding. | [#2204](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2204) |
| Speed and idle-work pass | Interaction budgets hold under real load, not only at idle. | open | Conversation switching and long histories slow down under streaming load. | [#2202](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2202) |
| Storage admission and reclaim | o8 never blocks a dispatch it could have serviced, and never fills the disk. | open | Admission uses one flat free-space reserve instead of the job's size; a stale dashboard write can replay a prior hold or queued packet after recovery. | [#2203](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2203) |
| Release channels and build integrity | Preview and stable are separable, and a build is reproducible from a tag. | open | Preview enrollment with an isolated app identity and data does not exist. The production web build also fails to resolve the shared settlement module; its source fix and build proof are tracked in #3268. | [#2205](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2205) |

Windows is help wanted. Maintainer VM validation is paused; a contributor can take a bounded child with the required proof. The port audit is written, with file-and-line evidence, in `docs/internals/port-audit-windows.md`.

## 7. Ahead

Longer-term bets, ordered by evidence and dependencies rather than a calendar year. Each row is an outcome we think operators will need, what already exists in o8 toward it, and the next child that would move it. A shipped child moves only the part it proves; a bounded outcome can move into an active pillar with an owner and an explicit proof. Basic remote project operation now has that scope in pillar 4. Rows are reviewed at the start of each month; a bet nobody has touched in a quarter gets cut, not carried.

| Bet | What already exists | Next child | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Portable execution across worker fleets. Placement policy, warm environments, suspension, and migration preserve the packet and merge gate. | Headless o8, the mobile relay, crash survival, the durable execution spine; a bounded remote-project milestone is active in pillar 4. | A portable worker environment profile, composed with cross-device continuity, extends the first remote proof to more environments. | [#1690](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1690), [#1727](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1727) |
| The right model for each packet, chosen and escalated by o8. A failed packet retries on a stronger tier without the operator choosing. | The carrier registry, per-packet model pins, the merge-failure escalation chain. | A worker escalation ladder that retries a failed packet on the next tier, with bounded attempts, the effective model visible, and a refusal instead of a silent fallback when the requested tier is unavailable. | [#2209](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2209) |
| Proof that travels. Receipts and control that systems outside o8 can verify and plug into, so o8 is the human gate inside other people's agent graphs. | Signed packet receipts and truth queries, the ACP orchestrator backend, MCP on both sides. | A receipt format another organization can verify without an o8 install, and a mission exported as an observed agent graph that an outside validator accepts. | [#1997](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1997), [#1998](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1998), [#2230](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2230) |
| Nothing leaves the machine unless you say so. Local and on-device models as a real mode with a test that proves it. | Local endpoint probes, the local chat tier for the Brain, an audit of surfaces without a local path. | A named egress baseline across a full packet lifecycle, listing every contacted host and surface, as the first narrow proof; remediation stays with the parked all-surfaces epic. | [#2228](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2228), [#1451](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1451) |
| Two operators, one approval path. Teams share a workspace without weakening who can approve what. | Principal-based authorization for operator, worker, and remote callers. | A workspace identity and role model. | [#1875](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/1875) |
| Agents that use the screen, not only the repo. A packet can drive a browser or a GUI with the same isolation, review, and receipt. | The embedded browser agent and its governed verbs. | Computer-use as a worker capability behind the packet contract. | not yet filed |

## Shipped

- **0.1.771:** project-first onboarding, permission success and restart recovery, agent-assisted setup, and the shared workspace integration ([#2817](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2817)). Existing-chat project changes persist before send; completed workers update without reload. Signed public artifacts and installed first-run restart passed. Broader worker and terminal acceptance remains in its open trackers.

## Claiming work

Start from a tracking issue above, open its checklist, and pick an unchecked child labeled `claimable`. Comment "claiming" on that child. A maintainer flips it to `claimed`, which expires after seven days with no linked pull request. The full protocol, including what a pull request needs before review, is in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#claiming-work).

## Not on this map

Bug fixes, chores, security advisories, and dependency work are tracked as plain issues, not as roadmap arcs.
