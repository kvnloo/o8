/**
 * Head-keyed review attempts (#1844 / #1856 recurrence).
 *
 * A `review_queue` row is a claim on reviewing ONE commit. Until v46 the row
 * did not record which commit, so the two states below were indistinguishable
 * from a live attempt:
 *
 *   - **Superseded.** A steer landed a successor commit while an attempt was in
 *     flight. That attempt is reviewing a diff that no longer exists, its
 *     verdict can only authorize a dead HEAD, and it still occupied the lane's
 *     single active-row slot — so `enqueueLaneReview()` answered "Review
 *     already in progress" and the successor HEAD never got a turn.
 *   - **Abandoned.** The process that claimed the row exited, or the awaited
 *     reviewer turn never settled. Nothing on disk knew the attempt was owed,
 *     and the only repair was a ws-server restart.
 *
 * Both now settle durably: a superseded attempt gets a terminal receipt keyed
 * to the HEAD that replaced it, and an abandoned claim is reclaimed against a
 * lease. Cancellation stays claim-generation-scoped: the exact row and owner
 * nonce are cancelled, never the lane or a later retry that reuses the row id.
