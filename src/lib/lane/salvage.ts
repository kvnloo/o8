/**
 * Shared salvage routine (Recovery layer v2, 2026-07-08).
 *
 * #1282 — a worker that FINISHED its edits but died (or went silent) BEFORE
 * reporting completion leaves complete, correct work sitting UNCOMMITTED in its
 * worktree, because the pre-review auto-commit never ran. Both dead-owner ticks
 * must save that work rather than strand it as a failure:
 *   - the reaper (`reaper.ts`) salvages a `running` lane whose owner died and
 *     routes it to `reviewing`;
 *   - the silent-exit detector (`silent-exit-detector.ts`) salvages a lane whose
 *     session went away and routes it to `reviewing` after verification.
 *
 * The "commit the crashed worker's work" step lived inline in BOTH ticks. This
 * module is the single definition — a regression here silently loses real work,
 * so it lives in exactly one place.
 */

/**
 * Commit any uncommitted completion output in a crashed worker's worktree.
 * Thin, deliberate wrapper over `autoCommitCompletionWorktree` so the load-
 * bearing #1282 commit has ONE call site both ticks reach. Returns whether
 * anything real was committed (o8-injected artifacts alone → false). Propagates
 * git failures to the caller, which decides how to route the lane.
